# Second-day-of-my-College
My Experience

On second day there was two classes of mine according to schedule. Ist class was "Peer Interaction About College".Our two seniors from 2nd and 4th year was there to interact with us. They tell us about the college website. They tell us about different section at college website. They also tell us about exam pattern. And this was all about today. 
Thank you
