# Second-day-of-my-College
My Experience

On second day there was two classes of mine according to schedule. Ist class was "Peer Interaction About College".Our two seniors from 2nd and 4th year was there to interact with us. They tell us about the college website. They tell us about different section at college website. They also tell us about exam pattern. And this was all about today. 
Thank you

"Third Day of My College"
It starts with adding new skill to my knowledge. Dr. Randhir Singh told us about how to make website on github. Our next interaction is with Mr. Sony Goyal. He is a great interactor and mentor. His session start with Wishing us 'Happy Birthday'He tell us the meaning of 'LIFE'. Then third and last speaker of day is Mr. Pancham who is 4th year mechanical engineering student. He tell us about role of body language that would surely help us in future.
